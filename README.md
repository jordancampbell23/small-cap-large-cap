Materials
•	App Link
•	Code
•	Pre-Work:
o	Data (run the EDA code)
	Look through and run the EDA file to get a sense of the data
o	Shiny (check out the following code and documentation)
	Open up the utilities folder (we’re only utilizing the data_card() function)
	conditionalPanel
	pickerInput
o	echarts4r (inspect the chart code)
	While the R website contains good documentation, a lot of the inputs in the current app were modified based on interpreting the JavaScript documentation in R. 
	
o	Challenge #1:
	Add or alter one of the views
•	Ideas: (1) Change the density plots to bar plots that compare total or average ESG scores
•	Generate pie charts of the indices by sector
o	Challenge #2:
	Add some brief explanatory text to guide the user and identify a few key insights. A couple sentences will do. You can use observations about how the title is formatted to position/align text. 
	Shiny tags documentation
o	CSS Challenge:
	Go to Google Fonts and select your favorite font and replace ‘Open Sans’ in the style.css file. Does it show up in the app?
