_ **Materials** _

- [**App Link**](https://reason.shinyapps.io/esg_data_app/)
- **Code**
- **Pre-Work:**
  - **Data (run the EDA code)**
    - Look through and run the EDA file to get a sense of the data
  - **Shiny (check out the following code and documentation)**
    - Open up the utilities folder (we&#39;re only utilizing the data\_card() function)
    - conditionalPanel
    - pickerInput
  - **echarts4r (inspect the chart code)**
    - While the R website contains good documentation, a lot of the inputs in the current app were modified based on interpreting the JavaScript documentation in R.

  - **Challenge #1:**
    - Add or alter one of the views
      - Ideas: (1) Change the density plots to bar plots that compare total or average ESG scores
      - Generate pie charts of the indices by sector
  - **Challenge #2:**
    - Add some brief explanatory text to guide the user and identify a few key insights. A couple sentences will do. You can use observations about how the title is formatted to position/align text.
    - Shiny tags documentation
  - **CSS Challenge:**
    - Go to Google Fonts and select your favorite font and replace &#39;Open Sans&#39; in the style.css file. Does it show up in the app?
